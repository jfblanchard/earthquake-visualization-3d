## DataSet

### US Geological Survey
[Significant Earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database), 1965-2016
Date, time, and location of all earthquakes with magnitude of 5.5 or higher

About this Dataset
Context

The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates this information immediately to national and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public. The NEIC compiles and provides to scientists and to the public an extensive seismic database that serves as a foundation for scientific research through the operation of modern digital national and global seismograph networks and cooperative international agreements. The NEIC is the national data center and archive for earthquake information.
Content

This dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965.
